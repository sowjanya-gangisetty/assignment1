      <h2>Green Color</h2>
      <p>
        At lower altitudes, the more frequent collisions suppress the 630 nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7 nm emission
         (green) dominates. 
        A fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. 
        The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to the high stability of the N2 molecule) plays a
         role here, as it can transfer energy by collision with an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. 
        (Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.)

      <h2>Blue Color</h2>
      <p>
        At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over 
        in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the 
        spectrum, with 428 nm (blue) being dominant. 
        Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the "curtains", show up at the highest levels of solar 
        activity.
         The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones.

    <section class="intro">
      <h2>Red Color</h2>
      <p>
        At its highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630 nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower 
        sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this colour visible only under more intense solar activity.
         The low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the 
         faint appearance of the top parts of the "curtains". Scarlet, crimson, and carmine are the most often 
         seen hues of red for the auroras.

      <h2>Ultra Violet Color</h2>
      <p>
        Ultraviolet radiation from auroras (within the optical window but not visible to the human eye) 
        has been observed with the requisite equipment. 
        Ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn

      <h2>Yellow and Pink Colors</h2>
      <p>
        Yellow and pink are a mix of red and green or blue. 
        Yellow and pink auroras are relatively rare and are associated with high solar activity.
         Other shades of red, as well as orange and gold, also may be seen on rare occasions. 
         As red, green, and blue are linearly independent colours, additive synthesis could, in theory, 
         produce most human-perceived colours, but the ones mentioned in this article comprise a virtually exhaustive list.
